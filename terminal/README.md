# 🤖 Waifu OS Assistant - LLM Enhanced

## 🚀 Project Overview
An intelligent terminal assistant that transforms natural language commands into executable system operations. Originally a simple keyword-based command mapper, now enhanced with GPT-powered natural language processing.

## 🎯 What We've Upgraded

### Phase 1: LLM Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo Integration** - Intelligent natural language understanding
- **Smart Command Parsing** - Understands intent, not just keywords
- **Context Awareness** - Provides explanations and categorizations
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment** - LLM-powered safety evaluation
- **Graceful Fallback** - Works even without API access

```

## 🧠 LLM Integration Features

### **Intelligent Command Understanding**
- Converts natural language to terminal commands
- Provides contextual explanations
- Categorizes commands by type
- Assesses risk levels intelligently

### **Example Transformations**
```
Input: "Create a file named report.txt in the Documents folder"
Output: {
    "command": "echo. > Documents\\report.txt",
    "explanation": "Creates an empty file named report.txt in Documents folder",
    "risky": false,
    "category": "file_operations"
}
```

### **Smart Fallback System**
- Falls back to enhanced basic mapping when LLM unavailable
- Maintains functionality even without API access
- Seamless user experience regardless of connection status

## 🎮 How to Use

### **Installation**
```bash
pip install customtkinter openai
```

### **Configuration**
Edit `config/settings.py` to add your OpenAI API key:
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

### **Running the Application**
```bash
python main.py
```

## 💬 Supported Commands

### **Basic Commands (Always Available)**
- `check ip` → `ipconfig`
- `disk space` → `powershell -Command "Get-PSDrive -PSProvider 'FileSystem'"`
- `install node` → `choco install nodejs`
- `open browser` → `start chrome`
- `make a file` → `echo. > hello.txt`
- `create file` → `echo. > hello.txt`
- `touch` → `echo. > hello.txt`
- `list files` → `dir`
- `show files` → `dir`
- `current directory` → `cd`
- `where am i` → `cd`
- `delete file` → `del hello.txt` (requires confirmation)
- `remove file` → `del hello.txt` (requires confirmation)
- `make directory` → `mkdir test_folder`
- `create folder` → `mkdir test_folder`
- `system info` → `systeminfo`
- `date and time` → `date /t & time /t`
- `network info` → `ipconfig /all`

### **LLM-Enhanced Commands (With API Key)**
- Natural language variations of all above commands
- Dynamic file naming and path specification
- Complex multi-step operations
- Context-aware parameter extraction

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### **Risk Assessment**
- Automatic detection of potentially dangerous commands
- Requires explicit confirmation for risky operations
- Keywords: `format`, `rm`, `rm -rf`, `diskpart`, `mkfs`, `shutdown`, `reg delete`, `del`, `kill`

### **Confirmation System**
- Risky commands require typing "I AGREE"
- Shows command explanation before execution
- Logs all commands for audit trail

## 🎨 User Interface

### **Enhanced Features**
- **Dark Theme** - Modern, eye-friendly interface
- **Welcome Message** - Shows AI status and examples
- **Real-time Feedback** - "Thinking..." indicator during processing
- **Rich Explanations** - Emoji-enhanced status messages
- **Enter Key Support** - Press Enter to submit commands
- **Command History** - Scrollable chat-like interface

### **Status Indicators**
- 🤖 AI Enhanced mode (LLM active)
- ⚠️ Fallback mode (LLM unavailable)
